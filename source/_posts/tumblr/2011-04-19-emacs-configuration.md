I’ve had my emacs configuration under version control for the better part of the last decade, cvs then svn, and for the last 3 years git. I finally bit the bullet, and purged it of private data. Since I doubt the history is that interesting to most people, I kept a local historical branch, and then truncated the master branch which is now available in my  github repos.

I used to use a monolithic .emacs file. When I declared .emacs bankruptcy a few years ago, I followed @rmm5t’s and @defunkt’s conventions… albeit probably not as nicely.
